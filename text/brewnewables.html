For the <a href="http://straighttoale.com/event/brewnewable-fest/">BrewNewable Fest</a>, we wanted to show how much fun you could have with just a little bit of energy. The LED on each wearable badge changed color in response to commands from the tablet or the rotation of the cube, no matter how far the wearer wandered within the <a href="http://straighttoale.com/">Straight to Ale</a> facility. The badge will function in this way for over 24 hours on a single charge.
