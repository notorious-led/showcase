This board is a retrofit kit for converting a common "tap light"-style fixture into a multi-purpose LED device. It sports 16 individually-controllable LEDs, four buttons, and headers for connecting a <a href="https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini">D1 mini</a>-style wireless module for easy control. Admittedly, the four buttons are overkill, since everyone loves to just smash the entire button, but hey, who's counting?
