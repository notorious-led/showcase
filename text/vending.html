This cigarette vending machine has come out of retirement to sell trinkets
from local artists, makers, and craftspeople. Located on the second floor
of <a href="http://lowemill.art/">Lowe Mill ARTS & Entertainment</a>, this
project is focused on creating a low-friction way for creators to share their
work with the public, even if the creation was a one-off, a low-quantity
run, or even something made for a laugh.

<p>
Feel free to view the <a href="vending_inventory.html">list of items currently
	for sale</a>. The vending machine currently accepts $1 and $2 bills.
(Its favorite is the $2 bill, obviously.) The machine <em>does not</em>
give change, so count well. Please report any trouble with the machine to
<a href="mailto:vending@notoriousled.com">vending@notoriousled.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are currently looking for people who are interested in selling stuff
in the machine. If that's you, please review the
<a href="vending_vendor.pdf">info sheet for creators</a>, or just
<a href="mailto:vending@notoriousled.com">email us</a> (we're cool).
