<p>This retired cigarette vending machine will soon sell trinkets from local artists, makers, and craftspeople. Located on the second floor of <a href="http://lowemill.art/">Lowe Mill ARTS & Entertainment</a>, this project is focused on creating a low-friction way for creators to share their work with the public, even if the creation was a one-off, a low-quantity run, or even something made for a laugh.</p>
<p>The vending machine currently accepts $1, $2, and $5 bills. (Its favorite is the $2 bill, obviously.) The machine <em>does not</em> give change, so count well. Please report any trouble with the machine to <a href="mailto:vending@notoriousled.com">vending@notoriousled.com</a>.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for people who are interested in selling stuff in the machine. If that's you, please review the <a href="vending_vendor.pdf">info sheet for creators</a>, or just <a href="mailto:vending@notoriousled.com">email us</a> (we're cool).</p>
